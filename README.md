# client-order-system
This project is a comprehensive Web-based Client Order and Payment Management System developed to streamline and automate client fee processing and order tracking operations. Built using JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, the system offers a user-friendly interface combined with robust backend functionality.

The application supports multiple modules, including client data management, payment tracking, and report generation. Users can efficiently manage client records, monitor fee dues, and generate detailed reports for administrative and accounting purposes. A key feature of the system is its multi-user support, allowing different user roles to access and manage the system securely and concurrently.

The system was deployed on the Apache Tomcat server to ensure stable and efficient performance. Emphasis was placed on clean UI design and secure, reliable backend processing. The project showcases end-to-end full-stack developmentâ€”from database design and server-side logic to client-side interactivity.

This project is ideal for small to mid-sized businesses seeking a simple yet effective solution for managing client payments and orders. It also serves as a demonstration of integrating front-end and back-end technologies into a cohesive, production-ready web application.
